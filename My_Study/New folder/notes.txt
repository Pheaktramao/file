The three parts of the MVC software-design pattern can be described as follows:

1.Model: Manages data and business logic.(a way for querying data to and from the table in the database.)
2.View: Handles layout and display.(front-end)
3.Controller: Routes commands to the model and view parts.(handle process.)
